# Bobi Scheduler
This is an app that I built to help a business. The good thing about it is that it can be used for a different kind of business. This one is adjusted for a business that rents the soccer fields by hours, but as I mentioned it can be adjusted to other businesses too... for example dancing studio, doctor appointments. The user doesn't need to sing up to be able to make an appointment, but they don't have access to change it or delete if they didn't sign up. I used the FullCalendar gem to show the appointments.
